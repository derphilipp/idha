Ist der Herd an - Is the stove still on? A little project: raspberry pi + camera + python + opencv + music = Music when the stove is running


How to use:

- Install a raspberry pi (rpi) into your kitchen
- Connect the rpi to speakers
- Connect the rpi camera to the rpi
- Mount the rpi so it can see your stove
- Fix the parameters used to capture an image (raspistill) to capture just the area of the red lamp
- Enjoy music while your stove runs!
